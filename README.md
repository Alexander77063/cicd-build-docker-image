- Runs on every push to the `main` branch and pull requests

## üöÄ Features

- Automated Docker image builds on push events
- Image tagging with commit references for traceability
- Docker Hub integration for image publishing
- GitHub Actions workflow validation on pull requests
- Simple example Dockerfile with Nginx server

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Docker Hub account
- GitHub repository
- Basic understanding of GitHub Actions
- Docker installed locally (for development)

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Fork/clone** this repository
2. **Create Docker Hub secrets** in your GitHub repository:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - Your Docker Hub access token
3. **Modify** the following in `.github/workflows/main.yml`:
